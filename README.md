<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a software engineer with 1+ years of professional experience in software development. 
I am more of a problem solver than a programmer and always seeks the most optimal way to solve any problem.Despite my lower experience I have completed and delivered multiple projects on different stacks. I want to make it easier for people to understand data and use them efficiently.

Nowadays I am devoted to competitive coding and game development but open to good job opportunities.
